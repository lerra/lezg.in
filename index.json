Waking up to an emulated sunrise with red, transforming to yellow and then to normal light over a period of fifteen minutes and then, the TV kicking on the circle of life from the Lion king movie. I could start up every morning with a smile and less grumpy. So, I started to think, what’s missing to make my mornings even more awesome. The idea with having fresh coffee would be a great. The only problem I had then was the time, then came the pandemic, as jay-z would say, I got 99 problems, but a time ain’t one. I already had some wires, ESP’s and relays already but I was unsure how the inside of the coffee machine was wired. I was speaking to my friend Peter over the phone that is so deep into the electronics that it is insane, and I told him about what I was planning to do. He said that I might not need a relay to do this and could use the ESP to do this depending on the voltage. He found the service manual online and was checking it but could not find any details about the circuit board and without me thinking it through, we started to disassemble it. One hour later, I measured with the multimeter to see where to hook into the circuit and we identified that the voltage is 4.3v and Peter told me that the ESP only supports 3.6V. We decided to test it out anyway and the sacrifice an ESP if it would get killed during the test as other have successfully been running even with 5V. The benefit of a successful test would be one less component (the relay). The circuit board was a lot denser than I thought, and I have not soldered in 20 years, so we agreed that we would meet up to get some help and learn how to do it myself. It took a month before we did that due to the pandemic. Now, working from home and no coffee for a month was challenging. Meanwhile, I ordered the Non-contact liquid sensor from CQRobot to be able to detect water through the plastic container (it also works through glass). With the sensor in place, I could make sure to not turn on the grinding process if the machine was not prepared. Acter a couple of weeks, I got sensor and started to play around with it and identifying exactly where to put the sensor. It’s a really cool one and works by using the sensing capacitance of water and gives back a binary value as a result. So, after a month when we met and started to solder the cables to ground, the “turn on” button and the “start grinding” button. We did a test with the on button and ground connected to see if we needed a relay or not, eventually a new ESP if it would get burned during the test. It turned out that the ESP could manage it and you can see it turning on the coffee machine (the red light on the circuit). To test the ESP32 if it can handle the 4.3V without burn, the following code was deployed on the ESP through arduino studio before we started to solder. void setup() { pinMode(15, OUTPUT); } void loop() { digitalWrite(15,HIGH); delay(5000); digitalWrite(15, LOW); delay(500); } The right solder joint is the on microswitch and the left one is the grind microswitch and ground was connected hereThe curcit board of the Philips Grind \u0026 Brew HD7762 with the cables soldered to grind and on microswitches \" The right solder joint is the on microswitch and the left one is the grind microswitch and ground was connected here So, I started to evolve the code and halfway there I bumped over an article in my rss reader about a home assistant project built upon esphome. I realized I was looking into that project a while ago but forget the existence. Even if I have invested some time into the code, I realized that I would never come close to the features esphome. It is tightly integrated with home assistant, the possibility to update the code with the OTA (Over The Air, no need for a usb cable to debug or deploy) and a real time event source api for state \u0026 log updates and a rest api, both over json.

When that is done, the entities will automatically popup in home assistant. If you plan to only use the esphome exposed API’s, you can find the docs here.

And Zhuowei Zhang is spot on on his tweet, Never spend 6 minutes doing something by hand when you can spend 6 hours failing to automate it — Zhuowei Zhang (@zhuowei) April 26, 2020 Security Esphome does not (yet) support ssl/tls if you dont run a ESP8266 but it is a poor and unsecure implementation. I recommend having separate network segments for both the server \u0026 ESP32, firewall the communication and use separate wpa2 ssid for the device until there is a TLS feature. Safety Don’t forget to turn on the “keep-warm” functionality on the coffee machine, this will make the appliance to automatically turn it self off after a set time. I highly recommend it to get a safety functionality outside of the code to take care of such if something would fail. Creds Creds goes to the home assistant \u0026 esphome team, platform, and frameworks they have built is fantastic and I hope I could drive more users to a privacy first setup and Peter for pushing me during several years to get into the microcontrollers and electronics. PS. No ESP32 got killed or injured during the test, mine have been running fine with 4.3V for two months at the time of drafting this article.
